## Summary
Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne disease that occurs in tropical and sub-tropical parts of the world. In mild cases, symptoms are similar to the flu: fever, rash, and muscle and joint pain. In severe cases, dengue fever can cause severe bleeding, low blood pressure, and even death.

Because it is carried by mosquitoes, the transmission dynamics of dengue are related to climate variables such as temperature and precipitation. Although the relationship to climate is complex, a growing number of scientists argue that climate change is likely to produce distributional shifts that will have significant public health implications worldwide.

In this project, I predict the number of dengue fever cases reported each week in San Juan, Puerto Rico and Iquitos, Peru using environmental data collected by various U.S. Federal Government agenciesâ€”from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in the U.S. Department of Commerce. This is one of the competitions in drivendata.org.

## EDA
Before I show my EDA step, I want to talk about train and test split on my dataset. This is a historical data, so I cannot use a random train and test split in scikit learn. Therefore, I arrange dataset with date and use past 80% of data as a train to test predicting remaining 20%.

Even though both Iquitos and San Juan are located in the tropical region, their detailed weather conditions are very different. These two plots show diurnal temperature range and precipitation distribution in both cities. As I can see, San Juan's weather does not change dramatically and it seems weather condition stay similar throughout a day. On the other hand, Iquitos's weather condition is varied in diurnal temperature and precipitation of season.

Due to different weather condition, it may inference number of dengue fever report in each city. San Juan has a long-suffering history of dengue fever since 1990. Also, They had outbreak dengue fever season in 1994 and 1998. On the other hand, dengue fever seems a new disease that Iquitos may not experience until 2000, and Iquitos's overall dengue fever case reports are relatively lower than San Juan's case reports.

## Model
In this case, I use gradient boosting regressor to predict dengue fever report in each week. Gradient boosting regressor is a machine learning method, which builds a prediction model with an ensemble of weak previous models. By this, gradient boosting model finds optimization of the loss function. 
For evaluating the model, I use Mean Absolute Error(MAE), which use the absolute value of error to measure the difference between my prediction and actual cases. 
My model's MAE is 14.58 on the test set, and when I check with actual cases in both cities, this model has some power of predicting outbreak seasons of dengue fever spread in both cities.

## Conclusion
This model can be useful to prepare vaccines, so it can prevent dengue fever spread in two cities. Predicting disease occurrence is not easy with just weather data because there are too many changeable variables and there can be some features that may influence heavily on dengue fever spread such as pollution, global warming, and other environmental factors that may cause mosquitos grow. 
Moreover, my model is weak to predict major outbreaking seasons in both cities. Therefore, to improve my model, I should concentrate on study outbreak seasons with meteorologists and entomologists.
